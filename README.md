# Gen_Sim
Generator Simulator - 2 generators for a ship that must have their voltages synced up (manually) before bringing them on-line or they'll cause a ship-wide blackout!

There are no instuctions because it is meant to simulate a live test.

You should start in the engine room and start the generators, then view the gages on the switchboard panel.
